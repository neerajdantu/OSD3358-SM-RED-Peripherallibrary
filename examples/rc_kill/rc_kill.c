* rc_kill.c
*
* Useful program for shutting down any existing program using robotics cape
* library resources. It accomplishes this by looking for the PID file created
* by rc_initialize(). If that Process ID is still running, it sends the 
* shutdown signal SIGINT. If that doesn't work then kill it with SIGKILL.
